# Yolov10uno
An Uno card recognition model based on the open-source Uno dataset from the Internet and the Yolov10s and Yolov10n models
The datasets comes from: https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/uno-cards
This is just an attempt. Both models have only run for 50 epochs, so their accuracy isn't good enough. If you want, you can simply run them using my template.
